% For delay health tech assessment optimal stopping project with Martin, Paolo, Steve.  
% This script demonstrates the calling conventions for creating problem
% structures, doing an analysis on those structures, and then plotting the
% results. Cut and paste sections of this file in order to run the
% analysis.
%
% Code is 'as is' and no guarantees for correctness.  
%
% (c) 2014, S Chick
% Created: 17 April 2014
% Last touched: 7 aug 2015
% 
% NEXT STEPS?
% (*) Do functions for more frequentist statistics (be it PDE or be it
% via simulation).
% (*) Do parking lot stuff to improve API/GUI after we know better what is 
% functionality we can do, and what end user usage cases might look like.
% (*) Fix apparent bug for Prob pick new / prob hit top when tau is quite large
% (*) See README-TODO.txt
%
% FIX: PARKING LOT 'TO DO'
% (*) Fix the list of parameters which are created by other routines for the
% advanced and mat structures.

%'note: if DOPLOT is set to true, then NumPlots should be small '
%'otherwise it takes long to run, but then the contour plots are '
%'a bit wiggly. For smoother/better contour plots, set NumPlots '

%
% 'basic' specifies most of the experimental specific information.
% 'advanced' specifies special computation, plotting, and other analysis-specific information

% options. In each case, a 'constructor' method is called, parameters might
% then be tweaked, then a 'validator' method is called before computations
% of the optimal stopping boundary can be done. The 'validator' checks if
% all parameter values are sensible, and also computes some 'behind the
% scenes' variables which are useful in the computation of the solution of
% the PDE.
