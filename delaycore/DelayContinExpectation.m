% For Chick, Forster, Pertile paper on 'delay'.
%
% Edited 2014 to include improvement in computation value from Mills ratio
%
% Code is 'as is' and no guarantees for correctness.
%
% INPUTS:
% first,last: integers with first and last indices of elements of myvec
% which are considered to be in the continuation set
% pu, pd, psame: probability of going 'up', 'down' or 'stay same' in
% trinomial tree in backward recursion
% myvec : the vector upon which backward recursion is to be operated on
%
% OUTPUTS:
% rval : vector of outputs which is the expected reward mixing of the 'up'
% and 'down' parts
%
% NOTES: Assumes values with 'up' correspond to higher indices in the
% vector 'myvec'
