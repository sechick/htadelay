function [ basicout, advancedout, rval, errorlist ] = DelayInputValidator( basic, advanced )
%DELAYINPUTVALIDATOR checks the basic and advanced data structures for
%validity, and corrects values if needed, for usage in the Delay Differential 
% equations for the delay paper of Chick, Forster, Pertile (in alpha order). 
%It returns two main parameters, one with 'basic' parameters, and which 
%should be used instead of the basic and advanced parameters which are
%input to this routine. That is, use the basic and advanced OUT parameters
%for passing into DelayCurvesRecur (stage II of the backwards recursion, 
%which is a backwards recursion for a continuous time stopping problem),
%and then DelayStageOne (stage I of the backwards recursion, which is a
%one-stage lookahead story).
%
% INPUTS:
%   basic, advanced: two structures with parameters for the sequential
%       sampling problem and its computation. Typically this should be created
%       by calling the constructor method, DelayInputConstructor.
% OUTPUTS:
%   basicout, advancedout: updated copies of the structures which have been
%       passed as inputs, but with values 'tweaked' in order to make them
%       amenable for the computations. Some values are complicated
%       functions of the other parameters, and so it is important to use
%       the 'out' version of the parameters when calling the recursions.
%   rval: true if all is ok, false if there were some errors worth noting.
%   errorlist: text string which contains messages which explains some of
%       the errors worth noting, and how DelayInputValidator went about
%       fixing them.
%
% NOTE: This routine actually creates new fields in the data structures,
%   including: NumT, PlotCheck, muvec
