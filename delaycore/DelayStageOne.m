function [ matout ] = DelayStageOne ( basic, advanced, mat )
%DelayStageOne implements the stage 1 of the backward recursion for the
%delay clinical trial paper with Chick, Forster, Pertile
% INPUTS
%   basic, advanced: created by DelayInputConstructor method, as in one of
%       the Set*.m files, to describe basic parameters of the sequential
%       trial, and for computational and output purposes. Once created by
%       the constructor, values can be tweaked, then should be run through
%       DelayInputValidator to insure all data is ok, and to compute
%       intermediate parameters which are required by this function.
%   mat: a structure of output values of multiple sorts, with following fields:
%           mat.B0mat;          % value function
%           mat.Puppermat;  % Probability of stopping due to hitting/exceeding upper boundary
%           mat.Pnewmat;      % Probability that if one stopped at a given (t, mu), that new technology is adopted
%           mat.tmat;            % a row vector of time values for columns of the above matrices
%           mat.muvec;       % a column vector of mu values for rows of above matrices
%           mat.tvec;        % tvec is time values for the boundaries: may be different from tmat, as tvec tries to compress
%           mat.bndupper;    % info requirements to get at curves of boundary, whereas tmat is equally spaced, in order
%           mat.bndlower;    % to help contour plot, bndupper and bndlower are upper and lower stopping boundaries
%           mat.B0vec;       % first column of B0mat (might trim this as redundant), expected reward to go, at muvec, at start of stage II assuming tau samples pending
%
%           mat.RewardPITmaxIII; % Expected reward with perfect information at time t=Tmax
%           mat.RewardTmaxIII; % Expected reward, assuming tau samples pending at time t=Tmax
%           mat.RewardPIMatII; % Expected reward with perfect information at time t in stage II
%           mat.RewardMatII; % Expected reward, assuming tau samples pending at time t in stage II
%           mat.RewardPITmaxI; % Expected reward with perfect information at time t=0 in stage I
%           note that B0hat is computed below to give the expected reward
%           of optimally moving forward.
%               Note: Regret will be RewardPI - Reward for each of these three stages
%
% OUTPUTS:
%   mat: a copy of the mat input structure, together with some new fields.
%       mat.B0hat: vector of optimal rewards, same length as muvec
%       mat.bestsvec: vector of number of samples to take in stage 1. Will be 0 if
%           it is optimal to select an alterative directly without sampling, will
%           be tau+1 if it is optimal to take tau samples and move to stage 2, and
%           will be between 0 and tau if it is optimal to take a few samples in
%           stage 1, and make a decision when the info from those samples comes in,
%           (as opposed to not sampling at all, or not sampling enough to enter
%           stage 1). If it is optimal to sample for at least one sample in stage
%           II, then bestsvec will have an entry of tau+1, do differentiate it from
%           the alternative of sampling exactly tau but no more.
%       mat.Threshpoint; % indices into muvec for points A, B, C, D
%           delineate the areas where one does not sample, where one
%           samples less than tau, and where one continues to stage II
%           (when these points are defined, otherwise indices are set to -1)

% NOTE FOR SPECIAL CASE OF UKNOWN VARIANCE:
% Using UnkVariance to modify pu and pd (probability in trinomial
% tree) helps with getting right variance in unknown mean below, but the
% code below does not account for the learning about the unknown variance
% with samples. When running code with pu and pd influencing mean and not
% variance, the upper and lower boundaries have odd behaviors (they curve
% back in toward I/P, and even cross each other in some cases), and the VOI
% is underestimated - implying that Stage I sampling, when correctly
% computed, has more value relative to the estimate from Stage II sampling.
% This incoherency means that it is probably better to plug in an estimator
% of the variance for the upper and lower boundaries when handling the case
% of Unknown Variance. This is best avoided in BOTH Phase II (DelayCurvesRecur.m) and
% Phase I (DelayStageOne.m) routines.
% Thus, we issue a warning message here to indicate that even though code
% is here for pu and pd to handle the mean, we do not use it in
% computations. It is left here in order to enable further development on
% the calculations for unknown variance at a later date.
