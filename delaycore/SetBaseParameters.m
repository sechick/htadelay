% SETBASEPARAMETERS gives and example of setting the input parameters for
% the delay sequential trials project. If you are interested in modeling a
% new trial, make a copy of this file (or another Set*. file) and adapt the
% parameters. Please modify parameters after the initial call to
% DelayInputConstructor. The fields which may be changed in the basic and 
% advanced data structures can be found in the DelayInputValidator file.

% Please do not modify that file or the DelayInputValidator file (or do so 
% at your own risk).
